// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening. 
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// a variable is created called 'name' and is assigned to the script "Dane".
// a condition is made to check if 'name' is equal to 'Mary' or not.
// we see that 'Dane' is NOT equal to 'Mary', so 
// the condition else will be used to log 'How do you do?' to the console.

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}


*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// a variable is created called 'secret'.
// a second variable is created called 'code' is assigned to the number 123.
// a condition is made to check if 'code' is equal to 123.
// the condition is met, therefore 'secret' is assigned to 'super' and the 'code' multiplied by 2.
// another condition is made to check if 'code' is greater than 250.
// because this condition NOT met, the inside will be ignored.
// the console will finally log 'super' due to the condition previously met.

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

if(code === 123) {
  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}

if (code > 250) {
  secret = 'duper'
}

console.log(secret)

*/

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// variable 'isStudent' is created and is assigned to the value true.
// variable 'age' is created and assigned to the number 34.
// variable 'zip' is created and assigned to the number 55407.
// a compound condtion is created to check if "isStudent" equal to true and if 'zip' is greater than 80000.
// although the first condition is met, 'zip' is less than 80000, therefore we look to the following else if condition.
// the second compound condition requires 'isStudent' to be false, therefore we look to the following else if condition.
// the third condition requires 'isStudent' to be true! therefore console will log 'Welcome to Prime!'.

//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;
let age = 34;
let zip = 55407;

if (isStudent === true && zip > 80000 ) {
  console.log(`You're a student on the West Coast!`);
} else if (isStudent === false || age < 30) {
  console.log('What are your hobbies?');
} else if (isStudent === true) {
  console.log('Welcome to Prime!');
} else {
  console.log('How about the weather?')
}

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code. 
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment. 
// Should be number++.
number--; 

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and 
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true 
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*

// FIX - colorOne and colorTwo should be swapped
// Should be let colorOne = 'blue'
let colorTwo = 'red'

let colorOne = 'red';
let colorTwo = 'blue';
let mix = true;

if (mix === true) {
  colorOne = 'purple';
  // Fix- colorTwo wasn't changed to purple
  //Should add colorTwo = 'purple'

}
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4 
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;

if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) {
  console.log('throw away the food!');
}
*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'.

/*
let age = 21;
const minAge = 21;

  console.log('no entry');
